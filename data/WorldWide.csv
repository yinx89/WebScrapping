All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.  The Data & Customer Operations teams  The data team's mission is to  Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster  This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus.

This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]  About Quora:  The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.  About the Team:  Because Quora is such a data-driven company, our data scientists play a central role in the product development process by uncovering key insights from our data. As a data scientist, you'll work closely with engineers, product designers, and product managers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems. You'll also develop tools and infrastructure to scale and automate the analyses that enable rapid product iteration. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. We use a variety of tools -- primarily Python and SQL — to analyze data and communicate results with the rest of the company.  While Quora's data scientists come from a variety of backgrounds, including statistics, computer science, economics, physics, mathematics, sociology, chemical engineering, and so on, we all share a love for data and continuous learning. Especially in your first role post-graduation, we realize that mentorship is important for professional growth and development. Every data scientist has a mentor and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and support for your career growth.  To give you a taste of what data scientists at Quora do, here are some example projects:   Analyze traffic patterns to similar questions and understand the metric implications of duplicate questions Forecast growth trajectory of Quora in different languages and identify growth bottlenecks and drivers Evaluate long term effects of a ranking algorithm change beyond short term metric gains as shown in experiments Devise metrics and build dashboards to measure the success of a new product feature or initiative Explain suspicious metric spikes as measured by dashboards and A/B tests Make trade-off and recommend product decisions when a key metric improves but another one drops in an A/B test  Responsibilities:   Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions to influence product strategy and drive roadmap decisions Analyze data to understand the root causes of metric movements and uncover growth opportunities Design and evaluate A/B tests to make informed recommendations on product changes Develop metrics and create dashboards to orient the direction of product development and track the success of the product  Minimum Qualifications:   B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a scientific or quantitative field Proficiency in using SQL and procedural programming languages (e.g. Python, R) to manipulate and analyze data Rigorous coursework in statistical techniques (e.g. hypothesis testing, regression) Relevant past internship or research experience working with large data sets and experiments Demonstrated ability to exercise judgment and combine quantitative skills with product judgment to translate numbers into insights Demonstrated ability to clearly explain data results to cross-functional teams  Preferred Qualifications:   Experience in working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (Hive, Redshift) Experience pushing code and navigating a complex codebase Active Quora user with curiosity about the product  Further Reading:  Check out these resources (all on Quora!) to learn more.

We’ve set out to transform an industry, using technology to bring transparency and convenience to the car buying process.  And we aren’t stopping there. We seek to bring that same openness and simplicity to car ownership too, with payments, maintenance, and insurance in one easy app. At Shift, we’re building the tools that empower people to buy, own, and sell the cars that make life go.  About The Role  Data is core to this transformation, from building best-in-class pricing, to loan decisioning, to logistics optimization, to in-product recommendations. If you’re passionate about using data to fix an enormous, antiquated industry, you’ll fit right in.  The data  Millions of cars are bought and sold in the US every year, but knowing exactly how much your car is worth is a challenge. We believe that fixing the used car industry requires providing customers with fair, detailed pricing reports in beautiful, easy-to-understand interfaces. By combining as much data as we can get our hands on, from the millions of listings available online, to car auction sales, to every vehicle’s specific repair history, we’re building the most accurate, transparent pricing tool in the industry.  The impact  As a two-sided marketplace, serving both car buyers and sellers, our vehicle data and pricing models are core to the business. This allows you to have direct and immediate impact on the success of the company. Initial projects will include exploring data, building models, informing product decisions, overseeing experiments, and collaborating closely with engineers on our pricing team and beyond. You’ll have a crucial role alongside our team of data scientists involved in nearly every initiative at Shift, including lead scoring, user acquisition, optimal resource allocation, vehicle routing, and more.  What You'll Do  Build models from the ground up - from data exploration to feature engineering, to model development + optimization, and deployment into production Design rigorous experiments and interpret results to draw actionable conclusions Work cross-functionally with team leaders (in Engineering, Product, Operations, Marketing, etc.) to explain your analysis and make recommendations Facilitate objective decision making across the company by democratizing data through dashboards and other analytical tools   What We Ask For  Bachelor’s Degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, or other quantitative field: advanced degree a plus 2+ years of industry experience in a quantitative analysis role Knowledge of machine learning techniques, especially deep understanding for their benefits and drawbacks in real-world applications Excellent statistical intuition derived from practical, hands-on experience Proficiency in Python Experience writing efficient SQL Excellent communication skills that you’ve leveraged to influence product and leadership teams Curiosity, desire to learn, passion for providing a great product to customers  On diversity  Our company depends on balance and equality — between buyers and sellers, among employees, and in our relationships with customers.  Our mission to evolve car ownership and transform an industry is a challenging one. It can only be achieved by a team of diverse problem-solvers — engineers, designers, business people — from the same broad demographics as our customers.  Why join now?  We’ve built a small but highly talented team backed by >$275 million in funding from investors like DFJ, Goldman Sachs, BMW, and Nissan. In October 2018 we announced a deep partnership and a $140m round led by the third largest auto retailer in the US, Lithia Motors.

We're a fraud detection company using advanced machine learning and network analysis technology to solve big problems. Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.  And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide. Join us and you’ll learn fast about cutting-edge tech and work with some of the brightest and nicest people around - check out our Glassdoor reviews.  If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.  The Team  You will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low – and clients happy – by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google’s Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.  Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it’s down to the Detection team to investigate why.  The Detection team is core to Ravelin’s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.  The Role  We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.  Evaluating fraud models is hard: often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You’ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you’re investigating the veracity of the model itself.  We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.  The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job – and understand why both are important.  Responsibilities  Build out our model evaluation and training infrastructure. Develop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs Write new features in our production infrastructure Research new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour Investigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models).   Requirements  Experience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn). Strong analytical skills. Being a strong collaborator with colleagues outside of your immediate team, for example with client support teams or engineering. Being skilled at communicating complex technical ideas to a range of audiences. The ability to prioritise and to manage your workload. Being comfortable working remotely. While we are working towards getting everyone back in to the office, it is likely that the first several weeks of your time at Ravelin will be characterised by you or many of your colleagues working remotely. The ability to be effective in these circumstances will therefore be vital.  Nice to haves  Understand software engineering best practices (version control, unit tests, code reviews, CI/CD) and how they apply to machine learning engineering. Tensorflow and deep learning experience Experience with Kubernetes and ML production infrastructure. Experience with Go, C++, Java or another systems language.   Benefits  Competitive salary & equity package A minimum of 25 days annual leave + bank holidays Flexible working hours Individual learning and development allowance of £1,000/year Remote volunteer opportunities and monthly company charity donations Fortnightly team lunches with different people from across the company (currently via video chat!)

In this role, you will define metrics used to track engagement, feature usage, and user-centric outcomes. You will use data to uncover user preferences and quantify product experiences, all with an aim of guiding our Search and Recommendations team to build more relevant and impactful experiences for our users.  All of this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects: designing and conducting experiments: bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that the necessary data is accessible and easy to use: regularly presenting findings to the Data and Insights team, Search and Recommendations team, as well as the company.  Skills We're Looking For  Data manipulation  In our opinion, things that can be reasonably expressed in SQL, ought to be. We expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means a fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.  Analysis  Right now, our bias is toward models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful policy suggestions. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.  Modeling  You should have hands-on experience building machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised) and know how to incorporate your models into production workflows and product experiences. At the outset, this role will largely focus on experimentation and more foundational product analysis: however, some degree of specialization in either preference learning and recommendations or text processing and search is expected.  Tooling expectations  Regular usage of a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (ideally Python).  Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data-warehouse technology). Hands-on experience with self-service product-analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap). Training in statistics, econometrics, or machine learning, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies. Exposure to data sets used by Product teams. Chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, Snowplow, server logs) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce and subscription datasets).   Additional Comments  There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.  As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.

Our goal is to be the global go-to provider for connected devices in smart buildings, creating dynamic solutions for everyday challenges. Our mantra is 'innovation through simplicity' and this ethos drives our product development. We are a small, rapidly expanding team but already have a broad portfolio of blue-chip clients – a testament to the strength of our product market fit. We are supported by top-tier venture capital funds. Infogrid is an IoT platform (physical sensors + SaaS) capable of handling millions of data events from hundreds of thousands of sensors every day. With cutting-edge, low-cost micro sensors provided by several 3rd party partners we're able to turn any building into a ‘smart’ building at a fraction of the cost of existing providers. The simplicity of our solution enables clients to self-install thousands of sensors in a matter of hours, and receive immediate real-time data. With the analytics and reporting we generate, companies can run more efficiently, pre-empt failures, save money, meet regulatory requirements, provide better environments for their employees and customers, and be more sustainable. About the roleOur solutions are deployed to 100+ clients in a range of industries - healthcare, commercial property, retail - producing access to a large (1bn+ and counting) number of data points and a unique dataset for building a differentiated AI capability - and we’re just getting started. Through data science we are in the process of developing a platform that influences building owners, managers, and users towards a more sustainable future through transparency on otherwise hidden processes. We elucidate this through both direct sensor outputs (such as: current air temperature) and algorithmically-inferred outputs (such as: a temperature sensor placed in thermal contact with a water pipe can be used to infer water flow within the pipe). Synthesising all these outputs to build up a holistic picture of a building, with an understanding of the interrelationships of the sensors - we access an ability to offer insights (such as on underused spaces), recommended actions (such as how to improve energy efficiency), and predictive aids to planning (such as when to increase capacity), in a real-time fashion that has never previously been possible as this data was unavailable. We innovate at the edge of what can be done in the new era of IoT, and we are at an inflection point in the centrality of data science to our growth - we are currently led by a highly-qualified team that we seek to expand by several senior hires that have room to grow in responsibility as the company continues to grow further.

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.  Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools: informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis: running experiments: performing causal analysis: informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates: building production machine learning and optimisation models: and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.  At Deliveroo we’re always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we’re working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.  Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we’re investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We’re looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.  Some Of The Problems We’re Working To Solve  How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments? How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage? How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments? How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects? How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out? How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?   Responsibilities  Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation.  Leveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methods Prototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstances Prototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team   Qualifications  PhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematics Broad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methods  Familiarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset  Data Science at Deliveroo  We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.  There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.  Benefits And Diversity  At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare.

Unlike traditional workflow automation tools RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the applications graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.    RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user.

Our Climate Analytics team is McKinsey’s core team of experts who analyze, and generate insights from, the quantitative impact of climate change for our clients.  McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team is a small, close-knit team of ~8 within a broader team called ACRE. ACRE is composed of ~40 data scientists, engineers and expert consultants dedicated to conducting advanced analytics for food and agriculture clients. Although our Climate Analytics team is officially part of ACRE, and many of your core clients served will be agriculture clients because of this, our Climate Analytics team works across all sectors at McKinsey being impacted by climate change—for example, the public, energy, and financial sectors. Regardless of the sectors in which you work, you will get the opportunity to work with multi-disciplinary teams with digital, analytics, research and business backgrounds.  ACRE—and through extension, our Climate Analytics team—is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients. (Please note that all work right now is remote due to COVID-19).  What You'll Do You will leverage deep knowledge of climate and earth systems as well as analytical expertise to provide insights to clients (as part of a client service team), within ACRE by strengthening our core client product offerings, and across McKinsey and the public by synthesizing and disseminating climate-related insights via internally and externally published articles and visualizations.  Approximately half of your time will be spent solving specific business problems on client projects (either remotely or on site) and the other half of your time spent developing new, or improving upon existing, products for the Climate Analytics team within ACRE.  As a member of a client service team, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to design solutions to core business problems that best meet client needs and communicate the outcomes and insights of your work to primarily non-technical executive audiences. Some of the issues we are tasked with on a client project include retrieving and processing large amounts of data from cloud storage, conducting analyses and generating insight based on medium to long term projected changes in climate, and more generally utilizing climate domain expertise to provide climate-specific insight and inform strategy for addressing climate risk across industries.  When working internally with the ACRE team, you will improve current product offerings (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will work in a collaborative agile team environment where you will bring together a variety of global data sources, implement different algorithms and utilize cutting edge methodologies and approaches to develop proprietary solutions. You will work together with our data engineering team to design and deploy applications and dashboards to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.  Along the way, you will learn how to structure business problems and serve as a client advisor while working closely with other data scientists/engineers and senior leaders across industries shaping the future of climate. You will have access to unparalleled career acceleration, with ownership and responsibility to lead the work you do from day one in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will have the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world.

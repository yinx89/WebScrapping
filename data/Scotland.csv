This role will focus on the design and development of a novel transmitter and receiver architecture that significantly reduces transmitter power loss to no detriment of the spectrum efficiency of the existing solutions. A number of prototypes and development cycles will be required to achieve the ideal combination of modulation bandwidth, current capacity, and power efficiency. An improvement of at least one order of magnitude in power efficiency should be targeted.  Key Dates  30-6-2019: Launch 15 PhD positions for 15 Early-Stage Researchers (ESRs)  31-07-2019: Deadline for on-line applications (or as soon as the positions are filled) 01-11-2019: Target starting date for ESR contracts  All applications should proceed through the on-line recruitment portal on the https://enlightem.eu website.  The Core Responsibilities Include  Review of existing power supply, driver, and receiver architectures (including existing literature).

Implement prototypes of the developed architectures and characterise performance across modulation bandwidth, current capacity, and power efficiency. Prepare patent filing submissions covering novel IP developed during the course of the programme. Participate in the ENLIGHT’EM network’s training programmes and secondments to partner organisations. Collaborate with other partner organisations of the Network. Ensure pureLiFi’s adherence to the terms of the programme.  Applicants need to fully respect three eligibility criteria (to be demonstrated in the CV):   Early-stage researchers (ESR) are those who are, at the time of recruitment, in the first four years (full-time equivalent) of their research careers. This is measured from the date when they obtained the degree which formally entitles them to embark on a doctorate, either in the country in which the degree was obtained or in the country in which the research training is provided, irrespective of whether or not a doctorate was envisaged.  International mobility: ESRs are required to undertake trans-national mobility (i.e., move from one country to another) when taking up the appointment. At the time of recruitment, researchers must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the country of their hiring organization for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately prior to their recruitment. For instance, a researcher who has resided in Spain for 15 months in the last three years cannot apply to any of the three PhD positions in Spain, but can apply to the any of the other 12 PhD positions. Compulsory national service and short stays, such as holidays, are not taken into account.  English language proficiency: ESRs must demonstrate proficiency in both written and spoken English.

Due to their success, they're looking to expand their team and as part of that are looking to enhance the research skills within the team.  The company already work with multi-national clients across many different industries, but their clientele is expanding all the time. Having been around for over 20 years now, they are globally known as the market leaders within their field!  What will I be doing?  Great question!  As mentioned, the company are looking to bring in extra research skills to their experienced UX team.  They've recently received significant financial investment and are growing the technical team on the back of this with some new key hires. The company are also looking to re-develop and improve their award-winning platform and are working with a range of modern tech to ensure they stay ahead of their competition within the market!  As the User Researcher Lead within the business, you'll work closely with a range of stakeholders across the business. You'll obviously work closest with the UX team and will report into the UX Lead but there is so much scope to make this role your own and you'll have a lot of autonomy to do so! As the research expert, you can bring in your own ideas, methods and strategy to the business and will have the freedom to implement it in your own way too.  As mentioned, the company operate across the world, so you'll have the opportunity to research and speak to people from so many different backgrounds, which is super exciting! You might have to get involved with other parts of UX & Design on the odd occasion, but your main focus will be User Research.  One of the best things about this role and company, is that you'll be working on a product that generally matters. It's a product that improves people's working environments across the world and you will play a massive part in improving the user experience of the product!  Who am I?  Ideally, you'll have experience working as a User Researcher, UX Researcher, UX Designer or UX Consultant. Whatever your role is, it should be heavily weighted on research and you should be someone that has experience of working in product-focused companies in your career. This role will be key in re-shaping how the product is used by the company's customers so would suit someone that is motivated to make an impact in an already-successful business!  You should be someone that has proposed, planned and executed multiple research methods across your career. You'll have scope to use the research methods that you want and what you think is going to deliver the most informative results! You should be skilled in selecting the best research methods for different types of users and also have experience in recruiting users in different ways. From all the research you do, you should be skilled in analysing the results, sharing them with the rest of the team and implementing any interesting findings you make.  To be successful in this role, you'll need to be passionate about research and try to implement this into the business as much as possible. This'll involve educating your colleagues about the importance of research and also advocating best practices too!  In terms of personality, it would really help if you were an outgoing individual. The team you'll be joining work really closely together, so you'll have a great support network and other passionate UX'ers to bounce ideas off of. You'll be dealing with a lot of stakeholders so experience of this would be great but it's not essential as they can offer lots of training on how to improve these skills. The main thing that they're looking for is someone that is fanatical about their craft, if this is you then you'll fit right in!  Who will I be working with?  As mentioned, you'll work closely with the rest of the UX team. You'll also work closely with the Product Managers, Product Owners, Developers, Marketing people, Customer Success Managers, the company's subject experts and most importantly, the customers! As you can see, there will be lots of communication needed within the role so strong communication skills would really be beneficial.  What are the benefits and where will I be based?  This is probably worth knowing before applying. The salary range for the role is £30,000 - £45,000. The role is initially a 12-month fixed term contract, but this is very likely to be made into a permanent role or at the very least, extended beyond 12 months.  The company have an office in Glasgow but are looking to have a more dynamic and flexible set up when everything is back to normal. This means you'll have the opportunity to work fully remote (within the UK). You might be asked to meet up with the team every now and then, but this is by no means essential. If you do prefer to work in an office, then they're more than happy for you to do so!  At the moment however, everyone is working remotely so your first few months will be fully remote. Interviewing and on-boarding will be done remotely too.

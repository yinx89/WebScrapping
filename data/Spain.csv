For Ontruck, all of our data goes through the lake before it gets to the warehouse, and only the data that we know is useful and worth cleaning gets to the warehouse.  These tables are meant to be more easily understood and allow for varying levels of access to sensitive data through different schemas.

The candidate will join the research group in ESADE and the larger international research team of Alhambra.  In Alhambra, ESADE is responsible for two distinct areas of work. The first aims to assess the alcohol impacts beyond the health sector, and highlight the centrality of Health in All Policies for addressing alcohol related harm, like considering health impacts in marketing, taxation, agriculture, education etc. This work will further unpack alcohol’s impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), looking into its negative economic and social consequences (e.g., loss of earnings, unemployment, family problems, violence, crime, stigma, barriers to healthcare, as well as the broader environment, biodiversity, water and food resources, climate, cities, etc.). Unravelling the interrelations between alcohol and the SDGs, its positive and negative impacts and related socio-economic externalities, and how this links to non-health policies will inform the development of a compelling case for: Alcohol In All relevant Policies. A second area of work addresses workplace policies for alcohol prevention and control. Alcohol consumption has more effect on job productivity than on number of workdays missed, with associated costs being about half of the total social cost of alcohol in the EU. From an analysis of effective policies across Europe a set of policy measures will be developed for uptake in large employers and SMEs. Both strands of work will draw from data from a series of systematic reviews, analyses of existing grey literature, key informants’ interviews and bring in knowledge and know-how from other partners in the international consortium, to finally triangulate all the evidence to develop key recommendations for the EU.  The candidate will be responsible for the development of several systematic literature reviews and the coordination of interviews with key European stakeholders, preparing publications and reports, and the day to day running of the project. S/he will also contribute and be engaged to different extents in other ongoing projects and proposals, European research and collaborations.  We are looking for a candidate with strong skills and track record in undertaking systematic literature reviews ideally with publication experience. Skills would include analyses of contextual and policy contexts, and understanding of the health/alcohol field and the broader socio-economic and sustainability 2030 Agenda and discourse. S/he will have excellent oral and written communication skills in English, strong qualitative analytic skills and flexibility for international work.

285,2275864643,2020-11-04,Barcelona Supercomputing Center,Post-doctoral researcher - High-order methods for high speed flows (R2),"Barcelona, ES","Offer Description   Context and Mission   This position will work as a post-doctoral researcher in the European project NextSim. The backbone of NextSim is centred on the fact that, today, the capabilities of leading-edge emerging HPC architectures are not fully exploited by industrial simulation tools. Given the expertise of the partners, we will focus on aeronautical problems, but this upstream research can be applied to a variety of industries, some of them mentioned above, where the models used for design rely on the numerical discretization and integration of partial differential equations (e.g. automotive, wind energy, etc.). Current state-of-the-art industrial solvers do not take sufficient advantage of the immense capabilities of new hardware architectures, such as streaming processors or many-core platforms. The computing world has changed over recent years, with processor clock speeds no longer increasing, and multicore/heterogeneous platforms now dominating. A combined research effort focusing on algorithms and HPC is the only way to make possible to develop and advance simulation tools in order to meet the needs of the European aeronautical industry.  NextSim will focus on the development of the numerical flow solver CODA. The CODA solver includes classic finite volume capabilities and new highly accurate high order discontinuous Galerkin schemes, all specifically tailored for aeronautical applications, and available to all partners. The CODA solver will be the new reference solver for aerodynamic applications inside AIRBUS group (including aircraft and helicopters), as such, it will be used by AIRBUS group (including Civil, Helicopters, Space, Military) for the design of a variety of engineering applications, having a significant impact in the aeronautical market. And, to facilitate the transfer of knowledge to the wider simulations community, the developments of CODA in NextSim will be made available through mini-apps (simple feature specific solvers) and the various existing open source solvers of the partners (such as Alya at BSC, Horses3D at UPM or Aghora at ONERA), widening the access to codes and fostering transfer of know-how to user communities.  To turn CODA into the future aerodynamic industrial solver, NextSim defines the following objectives:   Re-engineer industrial aerodynamic solver CODA for the efficient use of parallel heterogeneous HPC-petascale architectures available now. Improve the convergence of current numerical algorithms for heterogeneous HPC systems that may comprise many-core and GP-GPU. Whatever the numerical approach used (Finite Volume, FV, of High Order Methods, HoM) and the number and complexity of the partial differential equations (PDE) considered: Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations (RANS) or Turbulent Scales Resolving Simulations (TSRS). Appropriate for adaptive simulations for which the number of DoF evolves during the iterative process while solving the system of PDE, e.g. in the perspective of h/p adaptation. This includes appropriate static and dynamic load balancing strategies Portable and versatile versus various types of HPC hardware. Bring the HoM technology to the same level of maturity, robustness and computational efficiency than FV to envisage its deployment in operations for certain class of problem Overcome barriers to achieving extreme scale computing by choosing the appropriate programming model: replacing synchronous with asynchronous communication: using parallelism at many levels: from the instruction set at the functional unit level, to large grain processes at the multi-node scale: improving energy efficiency. Solve a series of market aeronautical test cases but currently unfeasible because of their computational costs, and perform a comparison of the “before and after” simulation time and accuracy. Disseminate the project results through the “mini-Apps” idea, (see details below) or kernels for numerical simulation that will be open source, enabling researchers and firms external to the project to benefit quickly from any innovations. Integrating the user in the NextSim evolution. NextSim can only be successful and sustainable if the stakeholders in the consortium and potential consumers of the centre’s services are involved, get informed and can provide feedback in an adequate way.   Key Duties   Lead the HO activities to be carried out by BSC in NextSim  Interact with the different partners of NextSim to carry our collaborative research  Integrate low dissipation HO schemes into Alya software  Research in LES methods for HO solvers  Contribute in scientific papers publications and the reporting of NextSim to the European Commission   Requirements   Education   PhD in scale resolving methods for CFD  Msc in aeronautical engineering or similar   Essential Knowledge And Professional Experience  Experience developing in-house CFD codes.

297,2290672510,2020-10-14,Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal),Postdoctoral researcher in malaria epigenetics,"Barcelona, ES","Descripción  The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) is a cutting-edge institute addressing global public health challenges through research, translation into policy and education. ISGlobal has a broad portfolio in communicable and non-communicable diseases including environmental and climate determinants, and applies a multidisciplinary scientific approach ranging from the molecular to the population level. Research is organized in three main areas, Malaria and other Infectious Diseases, Child and Maternal Health, and Urban Health, Climate & Non-Communicable Diseases. ISGlobal is accredited with the Severo Ochoa distinction, a seal of excellence of the Spanish Science Ministry.    Lugar   Barcelona - CEK building    What We Are Looking for   ISGlobal is seeking a postdoctoral scientist who is interested on working in the project  MalTransc . The overall goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of the regulation of gene expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.    The team   The ISGlobal Malaria Epigenetics lab directed by ICREA Research Professor Alfred Cortés investigates the regulation of gene expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We use a combination of approaches that include phenotypic characterization of parasites, molecular biology, multi-omics approaches, and genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 technology.  About The Project  Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most severe forms of human malaria. Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in malaria parasite biology, as it controls fundamental processes such as life cycle progression, developmental “decisions”, antigenic variation and adaptation to the conditions of the environment. Some of these processes are regulated at the epigenetic level, with a key role for euchromatin-heterochromatin transitions.  We are recruiting a postdoctoral scientist to work in a project with title “Transcriptional regulation of adaptation and developmental decisions in malaria parasites: from epigenetic variation to directed transcriptional responses”, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (RETOS call). In this project we will investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying heterochromatin formation and their role in regulating clonal variation and adaptive processes in malaria, and also the transcriptional response of the parasite to heat shock. The project will involve the use of multiple techniques including genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 technology, transcriptomics (RNA-seq/microarrays), epigenomics (ChIP-seq) and basic molecular and cellular parasitology.  Field Research  Biological sciences Training And Experience /Qualifications  A PhD in a discipline related with molecular and cellular biology Specific Requirements  High level of enthusiasm and motivation: passion for science!  Previous expertise in malaria research and/or in epigenetics/chromatin biology is desirable but not essential  Bioinformatics skills are desirable but not essential Key Responsibilities  The main tasks will be to design and perform the experiments for this project, to analyse and interpret the data, and to write the resulting manuscripts, in collaboration with other members of the team. The successful candidate is expected to contribute to the supervision of junior members of the team and to participate in the scientific discussion of other projects. Good integration in the team environment is essential.  Specific Duties  Experiments with P. falciparum cultures  Molecular and cellular biology experiments  Data analysis and preparation of manuscripts  Present results in scientific conferences  Contribute to scientific discussion and training of new members of the team   Skills (HR proposes for PhD student, serve as a reference)   Capacity to work both independently and as part of a team  Excellent written and oral communication skills in English  Excellent organization and coordination skills  Demonstrated track record of achievements Language Level  Excellent written and oral communication skills in English are essential Conditions  Duration: 30 months Starting date: January 2021 (flexible) Contract: Full time Salary Range: According to ISGlobal salary scales, will depend on the level of experience and qualifications During the crisis caused by COVID19, standard working conditions will be adapted to sanitary requirements.",Sin experiencia,Jornada completa,"Investigación, Análisis, Tecnología de la información","Investigación, Biotecnología, Atención sanitaria y hospitalaria",0,None,False,,2,None

402,2290923148,2020-10-14,None,Early Stage Researcher (ESR 8) - Salt,"Salt, ES","The selective process is open for the coverage of 1 vacancy for a PhD student at the BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF GIRONA DR. JOSEP TRUETA (IDIBGI) in the Department of Endocrinology (head of project: Prof. Dr. José Manuel Fernández-Real). IDIBGI offers a PhD position for an EarlyStage Researcher (ESR) for the project: Impact of the gut microbiome on cognitive function in middle-aged subjects. Effects of weight loss. The position is part of the EU-funded Innovative Training Network SmartAge (“Gut-brain-axis: Targets for improvement of cognition in the elderly”)  Objective Of The Project  To analyse the impact of age on gut-microbiome, brain microstructure and cognition, we will evaluate 200 subjects at both gender aged > 65-80 years from the general population. Longitudinal data and biological sample collection have been completed in April 2018 – as a subgroup - within the Horizon 2020 SHARE project - . Different domains of cognition will be explored: attention, memory and executive function (Stroop test, California verbal learning test, Trail Making test A and B) in association with metabolic variables and MRI scans including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Gut barrier function and inflammatory brain markers (ZO-1, LBP, progranulin) will be analysed on plasma samples by ELISA. Blood samples will be collected to measure various markers of microbial translocation/gut barrier function (bacterial endotoxins, CD14, LBP, ZO-1 and I-FABP), inflammation (progranulin, CRP, Tnfá, IL-6, IL-1á, IL-1â) and to process for metabolomics SCFA). All these variables were evaluated at baseline and one year thereafter. Exploiting data from a previous large-scale trial is a great advantage and will support us in examining the hypotheses presented here. The effects of weight loss will be additional evaluated with the same parameters before and 1 year after bariatric surgery in 40 subjects aged > 65 years, in an obese control group where dietetic counselling is provided and in non-obese subjects. Weight loss is expected to impact on cognitive improvement, the gut-microbiome, barrier function and inflammaging even at older age.  The PhD student will join a research group with extensive experience in the study of the pathophysiology of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and their complications. The main traditional lines of research are focused on innate immune system, inflammatory pathways, and metabolic diseases. Furthermore, the group has done significant work evaluating the biology of human adipose tissue and the role of the microbiome on the cognitive profiles of individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Currently, the group is elucidating the complex interplay among the gut microbiome, the metabolome (including microbial-host co-metabolites), brain microstructure, and cognitive performance (memory, inhibitory control, etc.), and its modulation by obesity.  Requirements Of The Applicant  We expect a Master´s degree (accrediting between 60 and 120 ECTS credits at the official university master's degree level or equivalent) in Health and/or Life Sciences (Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, Psychology, Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience, Biomedicine, Biology) or Medicine. Furthermore, the applicant should be able to perform team-oriented as well as independent work. Desirable methodological skills include: excellent background in systems biology, neuroscience, and metabolism, as well as experience in analysing large omics datasets and neuroimaging data. This will include the use of a variety of R, Phyton, MATLAB, SPM, and FSL statistical packages (machine learning algorithms, microbiome compositional data analysis, pattern recognition methods, brain structural and connectivity analyses, etc.) to extract relevant biological information from individual omics datasets (metabolomics, transcriptomics, and metagenomics) as well as from magnetic resonance imaging data, and their integration.  Very good language skills in English are required. Given that the candidate will interact with local patients, fluency in Spanish will be also considered.

PROJECT OFFER: TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF PRODUCING MILK FROM COWS WITH DIFFERENT BETA-CASEIN GENOTYPES  CN is the major protein group of milk, followed by whey proteins, where it is organized as micelles and submicelles, and shows 4 types (αs1, αs2, β and κ). From these CN types, the β-CN accounts for more than 1/3 total CN in cow’s milk and is especially important because of its impact on the technological and digestive properties. Fermentation and gastrointestinal digestion of milk proteins yield bioactive peptides. Several studies claimed that consumption of A2 β-CN is associated with lower prevalence of type 1 diabetes, lower mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and reduction of the intolerance and gastrointestinal discomfort of intolerant consumers to cow’s milk. For this reason, A2 milk has begun to be selected on farms and even sold. However, protein polymorphisms determine the suitability of cow’s milk for transformation in the dairy industry.   This project aims to investigate the effect of different β-casein genotypes (A2A2, A1A2, A1A1) in technological milk properties, products (high pasteurization and UHT milks) and their transformation (fresh cheese and yogurt).",Algo de responsabilidad,Jornada completa,Otro,"Lácteos, Investigación, Producción alimentaria",None,None,False,,53,None

The candidate will join the research group in ESADE and the larger international research team of Alhambra. In Alhambra, ESADE is responsible for two distinct areas of work. The first aims to assess the alcohol impacts beyond the health sector, and highlight the centrality of Health in All Policies for addressing alcohol related harm, like considering health impacts in marketing, taxation, agriculture, education etc. This work will further unpack alcohol’s impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), looking into its negative economic and social consequences (e.g., loss of earnings, unemployment, family problems, violence, crime, stigma, barriers to healthcare, as well as the broader environment, biodiversity, water and food resources, climate, cities, etc.). Unravelling the interrelations between alcohol and the SDGs, its positive and negative impacts and related socio-economic externalities, and how this links to non-health policies will inform the development of a compelling case for: Alcohol In All relevant Policies. A second area of work addresses workplace policies for alcohol prevention and control. Alcohol consumption has more effect on job productivity than on number of workdays missed, with associated costs being about half of the total social cost of alcohol in the EU. From an analysis of effective policies across Europe a set of policy measures will be developed for uptake in large employers and SMEs. Both strands of work will draw from data from a series of systematic reviews, analyses of existing grey literature, key informants’ interviews and bring in knowledge and know-how from other partners in the international consortium, to finally triangulate all the evidence to develop key recommendations for the EU. The candidate will be responsible for the development of several systematic literature reviews and the coordination of interviews with key European stakeholders, preparing publications and reports, and the day to day running of the project. S/he will also contribute and be engaged to different extents in other ongoing projects and proposals, European research and collaborations. We are looking for a candidate with strong skills and track record in undertaking systematic literature reviews ideally with publication experience. Skills would include analyses of contextual and policy contexts, and understanding of the health/alcohol field and the broader socio-economic and sustainability 2030 Agenda and discourse. S/he will have excellent oral and written communication skills in English, strong qualitative analytic skills and flexibility for international work.

We provide 24/7 security monitoring, investigation, alerting and response services to organizations in healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, retail and other industries. Proficio has been highlighted in Gartner’s Market Guide for Managed Detection and Response Services for the last three consecutive years. We have a track record of innovation. Proficio invented the concept of SOC-as-a-Service. We were the first MSSP to provide automated response services and the first in our space to provide a risk scoring dashboard.   Our typical client is a medium to large-sized organization that lacks the in-house resources to address the challenges of a rapidly changing threat landscape. The difficulty of hiring and retaining cybersecurity professionals are widely understood but our prospective clients also struggle to effectively harness technology and build hardened processes.  While Proficio has developed a unified service delivery platform designed to meet the needs of the most demanding clients, what sets us apart is the quality and passion of our people. We believe the SOC of the Future will meld the creativity of human intelligence with the power of advanced technologies like AI.  Summary  The Security Data Engineer reports to our Lead Security Data Engineer and creates the architecture and guides the workload/implementation of our Splunk SIEM customer instances - this role will predominantly support or EMEA and APAC operations, but this role will also provide support globally as required.

We seek individuals who are able to define work scope, bundle that work scope for team assignment, and then return the following day to pick up the work that was completed overnight for review/revision. Lone wolves are not allowed!Ability to work independently: This is a remote position that services customers across the US. We will hire where the talent lies, expect candidates to have a professional home office, and we will assume our staff are able to organize their customer interactions and workload so that progress is achieved with all customer accounts daily.We are doing great things! We want enthusiastic Splunk professionals who can share our passion with customers. Strong communication skills prior to contract execution will ensure our customers know exactly what to expect during the onboarding process. Continuous relationship building throughout the implementation and maintenance phase will ensure our customers are receiving our best in class service for their cybersecurity needs!The nitty gritty: 5+ years hands on experience in engineering and supporting a large scale Splunk (ES highly preferred) environment: strong event logging solutions for large corporations is preferred: experienced with multiple security platform administration or engineering within large-scale or global enterprises combined: understanding of Network Firewalls, Load-balancers, and complex network designs: good understanding of Unix/Linux and Windows operating systems, good command on Python, Perl, SQL, Regex and Shell scripting is preferred.The proof is in the pudding: (or in the certifications…) The following certifications are highly desired as they will highlight your commitment to this career path: Splunk Accredited Implementation Fundamentals, Splunk Accredited Core Implementation, Splunk Accredited Consultant, Splunk Enterprise Certified Admin: Splunk Enterprise Certified Architect, and Splunk Enterprise Security Certified Admin.Clear understanding of Splunk’s data onboarding process and CIM mapping.Ability to define and clearly express work required to customers.

ISGlobal has a broad portfolio in communicable and non-communicable diseases including environmental and climate determinants, and applies a multidisciplinary scientific approach ranging from the molecular to the population level. Research is organized in three main areas, Malaria and other Infectious Diseases, Child and Maternal Health, and Urban Health, Climate & Non-Communicable Diseases. ISGlobal is accredited with the Severo Ochoa distinction, a seal of excellence of the Spanish Science Ministry.Lugar  Barcelona - Campus Clinic CEK BuildingWhat we are looking for  ISGlobal is seeking apredoctoral scientist who is interested on doing a PhD at the malaria epigenetics lab under the supervision of ICREA Research Professor Alfred Cortés. Candidates will have to apply for a predoctoral contract (previously FPI) associated with the “Retos” grant MalTransc, awarded to the team. The overall goal of the project is to gain abetter understanding of the regulation of gene expression in the malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparum.The team  More Information At The Following Links  The ISGlobal Malaria Epigenetics labinvestigates the regulation of gene expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We use a combination of approaches that include phenotypic characterization of parasites, molecular biology, multi-omics approaches and genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 technology.  https://cortesmalarialab.wordpress.com/ https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/alfred-cortes-closas-375 https://www.isglobal.org/ca/researchers/-/profiles/2000  About The Project  Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most severe forms of human malaria. Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in malaria parasite biology, as it controls fundamental processes such as life cycle progression, developmental “decisions”, antigenic variation and adaptation to the conditions of the environment. Some of these processes are controlled at the epigenetic level, with a key role for euchromatin-heterochromatin transitions. We are recruiting a predoctoral scientist to cover apredoctoral contract associated with the project “Transcriptional regulation of adaptation and developmental decisions in malaria parasites: from epigenetic variation to directed transcriptional responses”, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (RETOS call).

The selected candidate will investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying heterochromatin formation and their role in regulating clonal variation and adaptive processes in malaria, with a special focus on genes involved in the regulation of sexual conversion, a process necessary for malaria transmission. The project will involve the use of multiple techniques including genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 technology, transcriptomics (RNA-seq/microarrays), epigenomics (ChIP-seq) and basic molecular and cellular parasitology. The selected candidate is expected to attend international conferences and to perform a stay at the laboratory of one of our collaborators (mainly in Europe or the USA).Traning and experience/Qualifications  BSc (and/or MSc) in a discipline related with molecular and cellular biology  Specific Requirements  High level of enthusiasm and motivation: passion for science!

ICN2 researchers have access to shared resources, including an in-house small clean room facility, the clean room of the National Centre for Microelectronics (CSIC-CNM) and the ALBA Synchrotron. ICN2 has about 230 full-time researchers including PhD Students, Postdoctoral Researches, Specialized Technicians and Group and Division Leaders. Research is conducted via independent research lines, broadly grouped into two areas 1) Nanophysics, including atomic-scale material studies of fundamental and applied character, theoretical studies, nanoelectronic devices, nanophononics, nanophotonics, NEMS, spintronics and nanofabrication and 2) Nanochemistry and Nanobiochemistry.  Job Title: Postdoctoral Researcher  Research area or group: Phononic and Photonic Nanostructures Group  Description Of Group/Project  Topological bosonics: design and optimization of topological materials  In January 2019 we started a 5-year EU FET-Proactive project on Topological matter in collaboration with the group of Quantum Photonics at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and groups working on electronic topological insulators such as the Physics and Engineering of Nanodevices group at ICN2 and the group of Topological Insulators at Würzburg University. Our main goal is to gain a radically new fundamental knowledge of the interactions and correlations between topological excitations (photons, phonons and electrons) in hybrid topological systems for efficient transfer and manipulation of classical and quantum information by a suitable combination of specific materials and structures, e.g. topological insulators and photonic crystals, and by designing device-like structures that host more than one topological quasiparticle  Main Tasks And Responsibilities  To develop low-loss waveguides based on photonic crystals hosting topological edge states with arbitrary shape. The technology breakthrough will result from the combination of the properties of photonic crystals (on III-V, and Si semiconductors) with unique topological structures for confining and protecting the edge states from localization and scattering with defects and a detailed study of emission, and subsequent propagation, of photons in topologically protected modes.  To develop topological photonic and phononic nanostructures in planar and vertical multilayer structures and use them to advance the fundamental understanding of the interaction between trivial (chiral) quasiparticles with their topologically protected counterparts.  Requeriments  We are looking for an experienced theorist with background in photonics, phononics and/or optomechanics, preferably expert on analytical tools more than numerical models, and ideally some expertise in group theory. From novel designs of optomechanical crystals, we need to delve into group theory and band-structure engineering to develop low-loss waveguides based on optomechanical crystals hosting topological edge states with arbitrary shape. In particular, we are developing semi-analytical models to treat complex photonic and phononic low-dimensional structures to implement topological properties with topological global properties that are, to a certain extent, immune to small perturbations such as unavoidable fabrication disorder. The candidate will conduct analytical theory combined with simulations using group theory to specifically design and optimize topological waveguides for near-infrared photons and phonons in a wide spectral range from few to 100's of GHz.

All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.  The Data & Customer Operations teams  The data team's mission is to  Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster  This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus.

How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps? How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful? What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question?

Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.  And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.  The Team  You will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low – and clients happy – by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google’s Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.  Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it’s down to the Detection team to investigate why.  The Detection team is core to Ravelin’s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.  The Role  We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.  Evaluating fraud models is hard: often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You’ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you’re investigating the veracity of the model itself.  We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.  The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job – and understand why both are important.  Responsibilities  Build out our model evaluation and training infrastructure. Develop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs Write new features in our production infrastructure Research new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour Investigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models).   Requirements  Experience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn). Strong analytical skills. Being a strong collaborator with colleagues outside of your immediate team, for example with client support teams or engineering. Being skilled at communicating complex technical ideas to a range of audiences. The ability to prioritise and to manage your workload. Being comfortable working remotely. While we are working towards getting everyone back in to the office, it is likely that the first several weeks of your time at Ravelin will be characterised by you or many of your colleagues working remotely. The ability to be effective in these circumstances will therefore be vital.  Nice to haves  Understand software engineering best practices (version control, unit tests, code reviews, CI/CD) and how they apply to machine learning engineering.

Our goal is to be the global go-to provider for connected devices in smart buildings, creating dynamic solutions for everyday challenges. Our mantra is 'innovation through simplicity' and this ethos drives our product development. We are a small, rapidly expanding team but already have a broad portfolio of blue-chip clients – a testament to the strength of our product market fit. We are supported by top-tier venture capital funds. Infogrid is an IoT platform (physical sensors + SaaS) capable of handling millions of data events from hundreds of thousands of sensors every day. With cutting-edge, low-cost micro sensors provided by several 3rd party partners we're able to turn any building into a ‘smart’ building at a fraction of the cost of existing providers. The simplicity of our solution enables clients to self-install thousands of sensors in a matter of hours, and receive immediate real-time data. With the analytics and reporting we generate, companies can run more efficiently, pre-empt failures, save money, meet regulatory requirements, provide better environments for their employees and customers, and be more sustainable. About the roleOur solutions are deployed to 100+ clients in a range of industries - healthcare, commercial property, retail - producing access to a large (1bn+ and counting) number of data points and a unique dataset for building a differentiated AI capability - and we’re just getting started. Through data science we are in the process of developing a platform that influences building owners, managers, and users towards a more sustainable future through transparency on otherwise hidden processes. We elucidate this through both direct sensor outputs (such as: current air temperature) and algorithmically-inferred outputs (such as: a temperature sensor placed in thermal contact with a water pipe can be used to infer water flow within the pipe). Synthesising all these outputs to build up a holistic picture of a building, with an understanding of the interrelationships of the sensors - we access an ability to offer insights (such as on underused spaces), recommended actions (such as how to improve energy efficiency), and predictive aids to planning (such as when to increase capacity), in a real-time fashion that has never previously been possible as this data was unavailable. We innovate at the edge of what can be done in the new era of IoT, and we are at an inflection point in the centrality of data science to our growth - we are currently led by a highly-qualified team that we seek to expand by several senior hires that have room to grow in responsibility as the company continues to grow further.

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.  Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools: informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis: running experiments: performing causal analysis: informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates: building production machine learning and optimisation models: and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.  At Deliveroo we’re always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we’re working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.  Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we’re investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We’re looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.  Some Of The Problems We’re Working To Solve  How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments? How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage? How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments? How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects? How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out? How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?   Responsibilities  Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation.

We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.  There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.  Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.  We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.  About You  As a User Researcher, you plan, design and carry out research activities with users that help teams get a deep understanding of the people who use government services. This research will inform policy, proposition, service, content and interaction design so that services work for users and achieve policy intent. As a result, you will need to be able to:  Turn research data into clear findings that inform decisions and involve colleagues in analysis and synthesis to increase consensus and challenge assumptions. Understand the diversity of users of government services.  Choose the appropriate methods for different stages of the product life cycle and situations and you know how to apply methods correctly. Understand the social and technological context for government services. Implement user-centred design practices and know how to embed them into an Agile workflow to deliver timely findings.    To Do That, It's Essential You Bring The Following  Knowledge of the technologies used to build and operate digital services, understanding the different technical roles in a multidisciplinary team. You know how to include all kinds of users in appropriate research activities to help teams deliver accessible services. Able to help colleagues understand how digital technology is changing user behaviour, and the challenges and opportunities for government services. Able to align user research activities with objectives to create strategic insights that inform policy and propositions. Ability to work in an open, iterative and collaborative way in a multidisciplinary team.  Joining AND  From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:  We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy. There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience. Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.   Still sound good? Great!

We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office: however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.  The Team  Here Are Just Some Of The Things We Help Our Clients And Colleagues Do  Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves.  Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy  Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators  Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors  Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps  Provide information for value development planning  Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications  Derive model inputs  Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers  Publish burden assessments for dissemination  Populate dossiers  Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.  The Role You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.  You Will  Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.  Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.  Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.  Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines: and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.  Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.  Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.  Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)  Review, track and own annual sales target  Direct other 'non-billable' activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).

The project aims to explain major global differences in cancer incidence, through analysis of cancer samples from 5,000 patients, covering 5 different types of cancer, and collected across 5 continents.  We are approximately half way through this project and are looking for someone to join the team to help us analyse cancer DNA sequence data from Work Package 1 by ‘chaperoning’ data through an existing data analysis pipeline.

We deliver teaching and learning of the highest quality. We play a leading role in economic, social and cultural development of the North East of England. Attracting and retaining high-calibre people is fundamental to our continued success.  Salary: £35,566.92 living allowance and £5,272.44 mobility allowance per annum  Closing Date: 9 November 2020  The Role  The University invites applications for a MSCA ITN Early Stage Researcher post, which is tenable full-time for a period of 25 months from the start date (planned to be October 2020). This post is funded by the European Commission as part of a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Network on ‘Cultural Heritage and the Planning of European Landscapes (HERILAND)’.  HERILAND brings together a consortium of 6 academic and non-academic organizations with 21 partners in civil society and business with the aim of empowering a new generation of academics, policy makers, practitioners, professionals and entrepreneurs. HERILAND integrates methods and approaches from a range of disciplines (history, archaeology and heritage studies, social sciences, spatial economics, urban and civic planning, design, geospatial technology engineering) and sectors (public agencies, universities, NGOs, SMEs, citizen associations) in a single, overarching framework for the project. Our research design positions heritage in the frame of five transformational processes which we identify as key challenges for heritage management in the 21st century: The Spatial Turn, Democratisation, Digital Transformations, Shifting Demographies and Contested Identities,and Changing Environments. Using this framework, 15 Early Stage Researchers will be provided with advanced training combining theoretical and instrumental knowledge in a series of research workshops, living labs and secondments with our public and private partners.  This ESR position is located within the third challenge, ‘Digital transformations’. The tremendous growth and dispersion world-wide of digital data sets, tools and services have a transforming impact on how humans relate to one another and their living environment, including their heritage. It has also given rise to innovative digital methods (e.g. citizen science, gamification, digital twinning and datascaping) that provide new opportunities to recognise, analyse and visualise how citizens and other stakeholders value the current heritage landscapes and involve them in the planning of the future. The role is concerned with heritage values and the potential contribution of heritage to sustainable urban development. It will be concerned with developing a framework for assessing the contribution of heritage to safe, resilient, inclusive and sustainable urban development through digital methods.  You will persue the following objectives: 1) to analyse the related Global Development Goal 11 to determine how heritage can be incorporated in the indicators for the Goal and/or how the relationship with heritage can be mapped 2) to determine which INSPIRE geo-datasets (available across Europe) can help in assessing the indicators 3) to collect citizen data, grounded in citizen science methods (including through collaborative mapping, social media analysis, etc.) that complements the available government data 4) to integrate the government and citizen data for several case studies to systematically assess the contribution of heritage to sustainable development. You will pursue these objectives as part of a transdisciplinary, international team through a series of case-studies in collaboration with other partners in the project, including planned secondments.

547,2222412942,2020-10-29,Ekimetrics,London / Lead Data Engineer,"London, England, United Kingdom","About the Role We have an exciting opportunity for a Lead Data Engineer in our UK team! ﻿This is a brand-new role in our UK office which has come about due to business growth and a need to better support our clients locally. Whilst this role is based in London*, the Lead Data Engineer will form part of the DOT (Data and Operations Team) who are predominantly based in our HQ in Paris and are responsible for working on data architecture, data engineering and development of data science projects. As the Lead Data Engineer, you will be leading challenging projects with international clients across diverse industries. This role will see you building bespoke analytics solutions to answer the key questions and consulting on the findings, (including presenting to senior clients). The primary focus of the Lead Data Engineer will be to lead the development of data projects, from advisory through to project management, with client interactions ranging from technical teams to CIOs. Your responsibilities will be spread across data architecture, business management, people management and Eki Life (the things that make us who we are), and include: - Lead projects from the kick-off meetings all the way through to final recommendations:- Analysing business requirements, translating these into strategic architecture and organisational recommendations and implementing projects within the set architecture and governance:- Driving high client value and broadening relationships at the most senior levels with current and prospective clients and translating this into new business opportunities for Ekimetrics.- Developing the skills of more junior team members, strengthening their impact on work across core areas of the clients’ businesses:- Supporting the business development initiatives and thought-leadership, transfer of knowledge to junior team members, and continuing to build Ekimetrics reputation and brand within the UK. *Please note, due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, we are currently working remotely. In any case, we fully support working from home, however, the office will be the primary place of work as and when it is safe to return.* About You The work will be rooted in the creation of innovative analytic engagements for clients so to be successful in this role, you need to be an all-rounder. You have a balance of business strategy understanding, client-facing consulting experience, and significant data and analytics expertise. You’ll currently be in a Senior Data Engineer or Solutions/Data Architect role (or similar) in which you regularly work alongside world-class data scientists and senior stakeholders, both internally and client-side.

You’re ready to grow yourself in the others! You’re comfortable building and managing relationships with stakeholders of all levels, adapting your approach accordingly, and able to translate technical terms into language that your clients can understand. Although you will be working with the Paris DOT, you will initially be a standalone function in the UK so, whilst it’s important that you excel at the strategic and theoretical aspects of evolving information systems, you are also hands on and not afraid to get stuck into the detail as well. For example, you’re not only interested in the pure architecture, but also building the pipelines.

The business was founded in 2015 by Rishi Khosla and Joel Perlman, who previously co-founded Copal Amba and grew it to 3,000 employees over 12 years, before selling it to Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) in 2014, returning 125 times capital to seed investors.Since its inception, OakNorth has secured over $1bn from several investors, including: Clermont Group, Coltrane, EDBI of Singapore, GIC, Indiabulls, NIBC, Toscafund, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund.The Platform has been deployed at various banks across North America, Europe, and Asia, and in the UK where OakNorth lends off of its own balance sheet via OakNorth Bank. The platform has helped OakNorth Bank become the fastest-growing business in Europe according to the Financial Times FT 1000 (2020), profitably lending over £4bn to date. In terms of the impact this has had on the economy, OakNorth Bank’s loans have directly helped with the creation of 13,000 new homes and 17,000 new jobs in the UK, as well as adding several billion pounds to the economy. With offices in London, New York, Manchester, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Istanbul, Gurgaon and Bangalore, the global team across the OakNorth Holdings group is over 800 people.SMEs are crucial in the global economy.

738,2204931447,2020-10-23,Infogrid,Senior Data Scientist,United Kingdom,"Senior Data Scientist About InfogridInfogrid is making scalable IoT (Internet of Things) a reality. Our goal is to be the global go-to provider for connected devices in smart buildings, creating dynamic solutions for everyday challenges. Our mantra is 'innovation through simplicity' and this ethos drives our product development. We are a small, rapidly expanding team but already have a broad portfolio of blue-chip clients – a testament to the strength of our product market fit. We are supported by top-tier venture capital funds. Infogrid is an IoT platform (physical sensors + SaaS) capable of handling millions of data events from hundreds of thousands of sensors every day. With cutting-edge, low-cost micro sensors provided by several 3rd party partners we're able to turn any building into a ‘smart’ building at a fraction of the cost of existing providers. The simplicity of our solution enables clients to self-install thousands of sensors in a matter of hours, and receive immediate real-time data. With the analytics and reporting we generate, companies can run more efficiently, pre-empt failures, save money, meet regulatory requirements, provide better environments for their employees and customers, and be more sustainable. About the roleOur solutions are deployed to 100+ clients in a range of industries - healthcare, commercial property, retail - producing access to a large (1bn+ and counting) number of data points and a unique dataset for building a differentiated AI capability - and we’re just getting started.  Through data science we are in the process of developing a platform that influences building owners, managers, and users towards a more sustainable future through transparency on otherwise hidden processes. We elucidate this through both direct sensor outputs (such as: current air temperature) and algorithmically-inferred outputs (such as: a temperature sensor placed in thermal contact with a water pipe can be used to infer water flow within the pipe).  Synthesising all these outputs to build up a holistic picture of a building, with an understanding of the interrelationships of the sensors - we access an ability to offer insights (such as on underused spaces), recommended actions (such as how to improve energy efficiency), and predictive aids to planning (such as when to increase capacity), in a real-time fashion that has never previously been possible as this data was unavailable. We innovate at the edge of what can be done in the new era of IoT, and we are at an inflection point in the centrality of data science to our growth - we are currently led by a highly-qualified team that we seek to expand by several senior hires that have room to grow in responsibility as the company continues to grow further.  What you will be doing●     Design novel sensor-based applications to solve hard and impactful problems for our broad client base●     Experiment with new technologies to harness an unparalleled dataset●     Develop machine learning models from concept to production deployment●     Whilst largely working in a team with other data scientists, you will also interface with specialists in other areas such as DevOps and the wider front- and backend-development teams to find the most optimal product solutions ●     Working directly under the Head of Data Science you will help to cultivate a team with huge growth potential and influence the trajectory of data science at InfogridWhat we are looking for●     3+ years experience in machine learning in a commercial environment●     Fluency in Python●     Experience with deployment of machine learning models (particularly AWS) is desired●     Experience with neural network architectures (particularly Tensorflow) is desired●     Experience with recommendation systems is desired●     A growth mindset, an interest in innovating new machine-learning products, and a willingness to work in a geographically-distributed team  Why we think you’ll love it here●     Fascinating challenges – no-one has a dataset quite like ours, which makes us uniquely placed to build AI products where solutions currently don’t exist. ●     Creative freedom - you’ll be joining us early on in our journey, with plenty of autonomy and room to develop your role as we grow●     We have a lot of flexibility on working times and fully embrace remote working●     Data science is at the heart of the company - your work will reach our clients all over the globe and set the trajectory for future innovation●     Competitive salary, holiday, perks and equity options package",Intermedio,Jornada completa,"Ciencias, Análisis, Ingeniería","Servicios y tecnologías de la información, Internet",93,11-50,True,,341,ACTIVELY_HIRING_COMPANY

We believe apprenticeships should be prioritised as a way of empowering people to build great careers, without first having to pursue 3 years of university education and absorb increasing levels of debt.By delivering training in partnership with world-class content providers, through a combination of 1:1 coaching and cutting-edge tech, we offer apprenticeships that genuinely rival the learning experience at elite universities. On top of this, we’re powering a social experience for apprentices to rival relationships students build at university. Bringing apprentices together through events and matching them to mentors who will help them develop a fantastic network.We raised a $16m Series A round last year, led by some of the world’s leading investors (including Index Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures). We were also listed as one of LinkedIn’s top startups and a Forbes ‘Ones to watch’ for 2020. We want to build an iconic company that becomes one of the great European businesses of our generation. Is WhiteHat making a social impact ?Research highlights the positive impact, both culturally and economically, of building a diverse workforce. Yet in industries such as tech, finance, media, and law, individuals from more disadvantaged backgrounds, such as those having a history of being on Free School Meals, are woefully underrepresented. Companies are aware that this needs to change, but by and large remain unsure of how to access talent from these groups. By encouraging employers in these sectors to take on apprentices, we can start to remedy the problem. WhiteHat is focused on developing future leaders: a generation of people taught via applied learning, with an emphasis on building skills alongside knowledge. At WhiteHat we have reached out to students from London’s most deprived boroughs, and partner with other organisations to support refugees and young care leavers. 50% of the applicants that come to WhiteHat have claimed free school meals during their school years: 65% are non-white: and 6% are care leavers.

This year we are expanding our geographical horizon from London to the rest of the UK, opening our first northern hub in Leeds. As a business, we want to see 35% of all school leavers across the UK choose to do an apprenticeship by 2030. As well as focusing on maximising our outreach in the UK we have exciting plans to expand further out into the US and beyond so we can give all people no matter where they are the alternative route to University that they need. ﻿What is the role of a Data Coach at WhiteHat?We are looking for a Data Coach to help deliver our 14-18 months data programme, working with both career starters and career builders to develop the next generation of diverse leaders in Data and help close the digital skills gap that exists.
